Nowadays, coronavirus or covid-19 is the greatest threat for all human beings. Staying at a safe distance and keeping a social distance is now the only way to stay safe. But, could we stay away if our family or a family member becomes infected? Obviously No... But unfortunately, we have to stay away...  To solve this problem, here I have made a Robot, which is controlled by a smartphone through wi-fi. This robot is capable of making a video call if you want to see the patient or vise-versa. This is also capable to carry necessary things. If you want to send something to the patient, it will carry and deliver it.
